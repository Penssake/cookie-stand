    <p>Seattleite Pat is a good guy. He's come up with Seattle's soon to be newest obsession. Pat has taken wild-caught salmon, chopped them up and baked right into his secret cookie dough recipe. Delicious!</p>
    <p class="paragraph">After years in the making you can now enjoy these fishy little treats in Seattle's iconic Pike Place Market, right next to the well known Beecher's cheese.</p>
